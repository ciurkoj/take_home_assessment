## Your mission:

A client needs to know what is happening on the social networks. All of them. Right now.

The three social networks the client is interested in are:

https://takehome.io/twitter

https://takehome.io/facebook

https://takehome.io/instagram

Because these social networks are so webscale, they don't always respond predictably. The delay in their response almost appears like someone waited for a random integer of seconds before responding!

Also, sometimes they will respond with an error. This error will not be valid JSON. Life's hard sometimes.

The client only has access to a Mac in order to use or run your solution (which could be a script, an application, an API or a web app, they have no preference). They need to view the combined responses in the following JSON format:

```
{ twitter: [tweets], facebook: [statuses], instagram: [photos] }
```

Order isn't important.

This should be a quick little task, but the client is paying us A Billion dollars for it so make sure your implementation is as robust as it is beautiful.

Don't forget to `git push` regularly.

Have fun!
